# fake-secrets

It's fake secrets to apply to development/testing clusters (e.g. minikube, test-staging,
...). This allows to exercise charts in production-like condition (where we have actual
secrets to discuss with various backends).

As the destination cluster can vary, the secrets are not declaring their namespace. It's
up to the helm caller to provide the namespace when installing the chart.
