description: A Helm chart to deploy the softwareheritage stack

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each
# time you make development changes to the chart and its templates, including
# the app version.  Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning
# (https://semver.org/).
# swh: It's not used so far.
version: 0.1.0

# This is the version number of the swh application being deployed. This
# version is a simple number to increment each time a new set of images are
# built and updated in /values-swh-application-version.yaml.
